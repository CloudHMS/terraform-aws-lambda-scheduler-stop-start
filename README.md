# terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start)

Stop and start ec2, rds resources and autoscaling groups with lambda function.

## Terraform versions
For Terraform 0.12 use version v2.* of this module.

If you are using Terraform 0.11 you can use versions v1.*.

## Features

*   Aws lambda runtine Python 3.7
*   ec2 instances scheduling
*   spot instances scheduling
*   rds clusters scheduling
*   rds instances scheduling
*   autoscalings scheduling
*   Aws cloudWatch logs for lambda

### Caveats
You can't stop and start an [Amazon Spot instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-spot-instances-work.html) (only the Spot service can stop and start a Spot Instance), but you can reboot or terminate a Spot Instance. That why this module support only scheduler action `terminate` for spot instance.

## Usage
```hcl
module "stop_ec2_instance" {
  source                         = "diodonfrost/lambda-scheduler-stop-start/aws"
  name                           = "ec2_stop"
  cloudwatch_schedule_expression = "cron(0 00 ? * FRI *)"
  schedule_action                = "stop"
  autoscaling_schedule           = "false"
  spot_schedule                  = "terminate"
  ec2_schedule                   = "true"
  rds_schedule                   = "false"
  autoscaling_schedule           = "false"
  resources_tag                  = {
    key   = "tostop"
    value = "true"
  }
}
```

## Examples

*   [Autoscaling scheduler](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start/tree/master/examples/autoscaling-schedule) - Create lambda functions to suspend autoscaling group with tag `tostop = true` and terminate its ec2 instances on Friday at 23:00 Gmt and start them on Monday at 07:00 GMT
*   [Spot scheduler](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start/tree/master/examples/spot-schedule) - Create lambda functions to stop spot instance with tag `tostop = true` on Friday at 23:00 Gmt
*   [EC2 scheduler](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start/tree/master/examples/ec2-schedule) - Create lambda functions to stop ec2 with tag `tostop = true` on Friday at 23:00 Gmt and start them on Monday at 07:00 GMT
*   [Rds aurora - mariadb scheduler](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start/tree/master/examples/rds-schedule) - Create lambda functions to stop rds mariadb and aurora cluster with tag `tostop = true` on Friday at 23:00 Gmt and start them on Monday at 07:00 GMT
*   [test fixture](https://github.com/diodonfrost/terraform-aws-lambda-scheduler-stop-start/tree/master/examples/test_fixture) - Deploy environment for testing module

## Tests

This module has been packaged with [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) to tests this Terraform module.

Some of these tests create real resources in an AWS account. That means they cost money to run, especially if you don't clean up after yourself. Please be considerate of the resources you create and take extra care to clean everything up when you're done!

In order to run tests that access your AWS account, you will need to configure your [AWS CLI
credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html). For example, you could
set the credentials as the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Install Terratest with depedencies:

```shell
# Prerequisite: install Go
go get ./...
```

```shell
# Test ec2 scheduler
go test -v test/integration/ec2_scheduler_test.go

# Test spot scheduler
go test -v test/integration/spot_scheduler_test.go

# Test autoscaling scheduler
go test -v test/integration/autoscaling_scheduler_test.go
```
